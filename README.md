## Welcome to my GitHub

This github page contains my open source personal projects. You can follow their development on https://ro-z.net

### Fitness data deep dive

I am interested in fitness app and how to do analysis on your outdoor sports data. I maintain the open source iOS app [ConnectStats](https://github.com/roznet/connectstats) that contains an [iPhone app](https://ro-z.net/blog/connectstats/documentation/) that has been around and in [the store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id581697248?mt=8) since 2011/2012. You can also find an accompanying [server](https://github.com/roznet/connectstats_server) to handle Garmin data using [their official API](https://ro-z.net/blog/connectstats/never-ending-service-and-server-saga/). As a bonus, the app [FitFileExplorer](https://github.com/roznet/connectstats) allows you to open and see Fit Files on your mac.

In the process of developping ConnectStats I required a fast Fit file library compatible with swift, so a [adapted the SDK](https://github.com/roznet/FitFileParser)

### Flying apps and tools

I am passionate about aviation and hold a private pilot license. I fly around Europe whenever I can, and along the way I have been building apps to scratch my own itches. [FlyFunWeather](https://github.com/roznet/flyfun-weather) helps me plan cross-country flights with medium-range multi-model weather assessments and route advisories. [FlyFunApps](https://github.com/roznet/flyfun-apps) is an airport explorer with interactive maps to discover and search fun places to fly to, and [euro_aip](https://github.com/roznet/rzflight) collects European airport and airspace information automatically from official AIP sources. For the fun of my passengers, [FlyFunBoarding](https://github.com/roznet/flyfunboarding) lets me issue them boarding passes before we go flying. I also built [flightlogstats](https://github.com/roznet/flightlogstats) to make it easier to work with Garmin G1000 logs.

### Tools to make my life easier

I published a [few utilities](https://github.com/roznet/quickutils) to keep my linux and macOS machines in sync, debug bonjour, and find iOS Simulator files from the terminal. I have also discovered Claude and loved the leverage it gives me for building software, so I developed a workflow around using it that includes [mcp-library-docs](https://github.com/roznet/mcp-library-docs), an MCP server for automatic discovery of design documentation across my projects.

### Project for learning and fun

[RemoteStash](https://github.com/roznet/remotestash) is a small tool built to substitute for AirDrop when you want to share file or text between Linux and an iPhone. It was build to learn about network discovery and exchange of information on the fly between phone and computer but it turned [out pretty useful](https://ro-z.net/blog/ios-development/how-to-airdrop-to-linux-part-1/)...
