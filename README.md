## Welcome to my GitHub

This github page contains my open source personal projects. You can follow their development on https://ro-z.net

### Fitness data deep dive

I am interested in fitness app and how to do analysis on your outdoor sports data. I maintain the open source iOS app [ConnectStats](https://github.com/roznet/connectstats) that contains an [iPhone app](https://ro-z.net/blog/connectstats/documentation/) that has been around and in [the store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id581697248?mt=8) since 2011/2012. You can also find an accompanying [server](https://github.com/roznet/connectstats_server) to handle Garmin data using [their official API](https://ro-z.net/blog/connectstats/never-ending-service-and-server-saga/). As a bonus, the app [FitFileExplorer](https://github.com/roznet/connectstats) allows you to open and see Fit Files on your mac.

In the process of developping ConnectStats I required a fast Fit file library compatible with swift, so a [adapted the SDK](https://github.com/roznet/FitFileParser)

### Flying app

I am also interested in flying and I am working on some apps and tools related to flying. One app to help students or low experience pilot, like myself, [mentally process cross wind](https://github.com/roznet/mental-crosswind) read out from air control. And another app to [simplify synchronisation](https://github.com/roznet/flightlogstats) from the Garmin Perspective logs (Garmin 1000)

### Tools to make my life easier

I published a [few utilities](https://github.com/roznet/quickutils) that i use to make my computer and developer life easier. From tools to keep in sync the configuration of my different linux and macos computer, to some tools to debug bonjour or find the iOS Simulator files from the terminal.

### Project for learning and fun

[RemoteStash](https://github.com/roznet/remotestash) is a small tool built to substitute for AirDrop when you want to share file or text between Linux and an iPhone. It was build to learn about network discovery and exchange of information on the fly between phone and computer but it turned [out pretty useful](https://ro-z.net/blog/ios-development/how-to-airdrop-to-linux-part-1/)...
